Objective:
The goal of this experiment is to determine the molar reaction enthalpy (ΔT_pH) for the neutralization of a strong acid with a strong base and to calculate the maximum absolute error of the molar neutralization enthalpy using error propagation methods.

Theoretical Background

The reaction enthalpy (ΔrH) refers to the change in enthalpy that occurs during a chemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure. For this experiment, we examine the neutralization reaction involving strong acids and strong bases, which follows the reaction:


\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}


In this reaction, the corresponding acid anions and base cations do not participate. The difference between the enthalpy of water and the sum of the enthalpies of \text{H}^+ and \text{OH}^- ions is defined as the neutralization enthalpy (ΔT_pH). This reaction is exothermic, and thus ΔT_pH is always negative.

The measurement of the neutralization enthalpy is conducted using a calorimeter, which is a closed system with thermally insulating walls that prevents the exchange of matter and heat with the environment but allows work to be performed. For isobaric processes in closed systems, the enthalpy change is defined as:


\Delta H = W^* + Q


Where W^* is the additional work done on the system beyond reversible volume work, and Q represents the heat supplied during the process.

If the calorimeter is thermally isolated (adiabatic), then Q = 0, and thus:


\Delta H = W^*


In adiabatic processes where no additional work is performed (W^* = 0), the enthalpy remains constant. During the experiment, the system undergoes a change from an initial state (I) with enthalpy H_I to a final state (II) with enthalpy H_{II}. Due to the exothermic nature, the system then reaches a third state (III) with enthalpy H_{III} at a different temperature. The relationship between these states is given by:


\Delta T_pH = -\Delta H{\prime}


Where \Delta H{\prime} represents the temperature-induced enthalpy difference between states II and III. This relationship enables the calculation of the neutralization enthalpy using the heat capacity C_W of the calorimeter, which can be determined through a calibration experiment.

Experimental Procedure

	1.	Preparation of Hydrochloric Acid Solution:
	•	Prepare 100 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a concentration of approximately 2.0 to 2.25 mol/L from concentrated HCl (37% by mass, density = 1.19 kg/L). Verify the required volume of concentrated HCl with the assistant.
	•	Perform two titrations using 0.5 mol/L NaOH to accurately determine the concentration of the prepared HCl solution.
	2.	Neutralization Experiment:
	•	The calorimeter setup includes a Dewar flask, a stirring mechanism, and a thermocouple with an ice-water reference point.
	•	Dissolve solid NaOH in 50 mL of deionized water in the calorimeter, and then add deionized water until a marked volume is reached.
	•	Introduce a few drops of phenolphthalein to monitor the pH change during the reaction.
	•	Pipette 20.00 mL of HCl solution into a transfer vessel, weigh it, and note the mass.
	•	Begin recording the thermoelectric potential (voltage) every minute for 5 minutes before adding the acid (pre-period).
	•	Transfer the acid to the NaOH solution and continue recording for another 5 minutes (reaction period). After the temperature reaches equilibrium, conduct a 5-minute post-reaction period.
	3.	Calibration Experiment:
	•	After the reaction, calibrate the calorimeter by supplying electrical energy using a heating element for 35 seconds. Record the current, voltage, and their uncertainties accurately.
	•	Continue recording thermoelectric potential for 15 minutes to capture the post-calibration period.
	4.	Dilution Experiment:
	•	Repeat the experiment using deionized water instead of NaOH to determine the enthalpy of dilution. This step allows assessment of the influence of dilution heat on the overall neutralization enthalpy.

Data Analysis

	•	Calculate the enthalpy change ΔT_pH for the main experiment and the dilution experiment using the measured temperature differences.
	•	The molar neutralization enthalpy ΔT_pHm is determined by dividing ΔT_pH by the number of moles of protons neutralized.
	•	Calculate the water value C_W from the calibration experiment using the formula:
C_W = \frac{W^*}{ΔT_K}
where W^* = U \cdot I \cdot t, with U as the voltage, I as the current, and t as the time of heating.

Error Analysis

Perform error propagation calculations for the following:

	•	Molar neutralization enthalpy ΔT_pHm
	•	Electrical work W^*
	•	Enthalpy calculations for the main and dilution experiments

Expected Discussion Points

	•	Identify fundamental assumptions that may introduce errors in the experiment, such as the assumption of adiabatic conditions or the exact calibration of the calorimeter.
	•	Discuss how deviations in the thermoelectric potential readings, heat capacity assumptions, or concentration measurements may affect the accuracy of the calculated enthalpy values.

Protocol Requirements

Execution:

	•	Record all values with associated uncertainties.

Evaluation:

	•	Include a graph showing the thermoelectric potential for both the main and calibration experiments.
	•	Report and calculate all necessary enthalpy values with minimal steps and include error propagation.

Discussion:

	•	Address at least two assumptions that could lead to experimental errors.
