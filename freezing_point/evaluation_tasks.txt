All errors are to be calculated using gaussian error propagation. 
Errors on initially measured values are the root sum of squares of deviations over multiple measurements and device/digitalization errors (if both are given, else only device error or no error if the value is fixed)

- Calculation of solvent mass with error
- Calculation of solute to solvent mass ratio with error
- Calculation of average freezing point with error for pure solvent and the three solutions
- Calculation of the difference pure solvent - solution freezing points for the three solutions, with errors
- Calculation of the molar mass of the salt by freezing point decrease using the formula M_2 = (theta * m^* / Delta T) * 2, where theta is the kryoscopic constant, m as the solute to solvent mass ratio, delta T is the difference in melting point relative to the pure solution, and 2 is a factor from the binary nature of the salt.

- Calcuation of the mean molar mass, the standard deviation, and the error by error propagation
- Additionally, plot the molar masses with errors over the used solute mass, as the formula should give better results for smaller solute concentrations
